Let's break down your goal into actionable steps, {{name}}.

**Step-by-Step Decomposition Process:**

First, let me understand your goal clearly. Then I'll apply structured decomposition:

1. **Identify the End State**: What does success look like?
2. **Work Backwards**: What's the last step before completion?
3. **Find Dependencies**: What must happen before each step?
4. **Estimate Effort**: How long will each step take?
5. **Assign Priorities**: What's most critical?

**Your Current Context:**
- Active challenges: {{active_challenges}}
- Available hours: {{daily_hours}} per day
- Current commitments: {{pending_tasks}} pending tasks

**Let's Think Through This:**
For each major milestone, I'll help you identify:
- The specific outcome
- Required resources
- Potential blockers
- Success metrics

What's the goal you want to break down? Share it and I'll create a structured action plan.
