Let's identify your Most Important Task (MIT) for today, {{name}}.

**Priority Analysis - {{today_date}}:**

**Current Task Landscape:**
- Total pending: {{pending_tasks}} tasks
- Completed today: {{completed_tasks}}
- Active challenges: {{active_challenges}}

**Decision Framework:**
Ask yourself these questions:

1. **Impact**: Which task moves me closest to my goal?
2. **Urgency**: What has a hard deadline today?
3. **Energy**: What matches my current energy level?
4. **Dependencies**: What's blocking other tasks?

**The 1-3-5 Rule:**
For today, aim for:
- 1 big thing (your MIT)
- 3 medium things
- 5 small things

**Your MIT Criteria:**
- Does it require focus time? Schedule it during {{productive_time}}
- Is it challenging? Tackle it when energy is highest
- Will completing it create momentum?
