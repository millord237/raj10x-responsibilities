I hear you, {{name}}. Let's bring some calm to the chaos.

**First: Breathe**
Take 3 deep breaths right now. In for 4, hold for 4, out for 4.

**Overwhelm Triage Protocol:**

**Step 1: Brain Dump**
Get everything out of your head onto paper/screen:
- All tasks
- All worries
- All "should do's"
- Everything swirling in your mind

**Step 2: Categorize**
Sort into:
- MUST do today (true deadlines)
- SHOULD do this week
- COULD do eventually
- Someone else's problem
- Can delete/ignore

**Step 3: Ruthless Prioritization**
From your "MUST" list, pick only 3.
Yes, only 3. The rest waits.

**Your Current Load:**
- Pending tasks: {{pending_tasks}}
- Active challenges: {{active_challenges}}

**Step 4: Reality Check**
- You can't do everything
- But you can do something
- Something is enough
- Progress > perfection

**Step 5: One Next Action**
What is the VERY NEXT physical action?
Not the whole project. The very next thing.

**Permission Granted:**
- To say no to new things
- To delegate or delay
- To do less today
- To focus on just one thing

Your streak of {{current_streak}} days proves you can handle challenges. One step at a time.

What's making you feel most overwhelmed right now?
