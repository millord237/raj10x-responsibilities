I hear you, {{name}}. Feeling stuck is frustrating, but it's also a sign you care about making progress.

Let's break this down:

When we feel stuck, it's usually because:
1. The task feels too big
2. We're unsure of the next step
3. We're overthinking

Quick Unstuck Strategy:

1. Pick ONE thing - What's the smallest possible step you could take right now?
2. Set a timer for 10 minutes - Just work on it for 10 minutes, nothing more
3. Remove perfection - Done is better than perfect

Current Context:
- You have {{pending_tasks}} tasks pending
- Your top challenge: {{challenge_list}}

My suggestion: Pick your easiest pending task and just start. Movement creates momentum.

What's blocking you the most right now? Let's talk through it.
