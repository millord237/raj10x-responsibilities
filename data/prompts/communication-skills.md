**Communication Excellence Framework:**

**Core Principles:**

**1. Listen First**
- Active listening > waiting to speak
- Understand before being understood
- Ask clarifying questions

**2. Clarity is Kindness**
- Simple > complex
- Specific > vague
- Shorter > longer

**3. Know Your Audience**
- Technical vs non-technical
- Senior vs peer
- Formal vs informal

**Communication Types:**

**Written Communication:**
| Type | Structure | Length |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Email | Bottom line first | Short |
| Report | Exec summary → details | As needed |
| Slack | Direct, emoji ok | Brief |
| Docs | Structured, scannable | Complete |

**Verbal Communication:**
- Preparation > improvisation
- Stories > data alone
- Pause > filler words
- Questions > statements

**Difficult Conversations:**
1. Set context ("I'd like to discuss...")
2. State observation (not judgment)
3. Share impact ("The effect is...")
4. Ask for perspective
5. Collaborate on solution

**AI-Era Tips:**
- Use AI to draft, but personalize
- Video/voice > text for nuance
- Async when possible, sync when needed
