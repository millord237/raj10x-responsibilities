**Modern IT Operations Framework:**

**1. Observability Stack**
Essential monitoring:
- Metrics: CPU, memory, disk, network
- Logs: Centralized log aggregation
- Traces: Request flow tracking
- Alerts: Actionable, not noisy

**2. Reliability Engineering**
| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Uptime (SLA) | 99.9% | |
| MTTR | < 1 hour | |
| Change Failure Rate | < 15% | |
| Deployment Frequency | Daily+ | |

**3. Automation Priorities**
Start with highest-impact automation:
1. Deployment pipelines (CI/CD)
2. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Pulumi)
3. Configuration management (Ansible, Chef)
4. Incident response runbooks
5. Self-healing systems

**4. Security Operations**
- Zero Trust architecture
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Secrets management
- Compliance as Code

**5. Cost Optimization**
- Right-size resources
- Use spot/preemptible instances
- Implement auto-scaling
- Review unused resources monthly

**6. AI-Powered IT Ops**
- AIOps for anomaly detection
- Predictive maintenance
- Automated root cause analysis
- AI chatbots for L1 support

**7. Incident Management**
- Severity levels defined
- On-call rotation
- Blameless postmortems
- Knowledge base updated

**IT Ops Daily Checklist:**
- [ ] Check dashboards for anomalies
- [ ] Review overnight alerts
- [ ] Check deployment pipeline status
