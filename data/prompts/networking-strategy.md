**Networking in the AI Era:**

**Why Networking Matters More Now:**
- AI can't build relationships
- Opportunities come through people
- Trust is the ultimate currency

**Networking Framework:**

**1. Define Your Networking Goals**
- Looking for: job, clients, mentors, peers?
- Industry/role targets?
- Geographic focus?

**2. Where to Network**

| Channel | Best For | Effort |
|---------|----------|--------|
| LinkedIn | Professional reach | Daily |
| X/Twitter | Tech, thought leadership | Daily |
| Events | Deep connections | Weekly |
| Communities | Peer support | Ongoing |
| 1-on-1 coffee | Key relationships | Weekly |

**3. Outreach Strategy**

**The Warm Approach:**
- Find common ground first
- Engage with their content
- Then reach out

**Message Template:**
"Hi [Name], I noticed [specific thing]. I'm working on [relevant project] and thought [specific reason to connect]. Would you be open to [small ask]?"

**4. Value-First Mindset**
Give before you ask:
- Share useful resources
- Make introductions
- Provide feedback
- Celebrate their wins

**5. Relationship Maintenance**
- Monthly: Touch base with top 20
- Quarterly: Catch up calls
- Yearly: In-person if possible

**Networking Math:**
- 100 weak connections < 10 strong ones
- Quality > Quantity
- Consistency > Intensity
