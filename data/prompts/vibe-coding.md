**Vibe Coding - The AI-Native Development Style:**

**What is Vibe Coding?**
Code through conversation with AI, where you describe WHAT you want and iterate on HOW.

**The Mindset Shift:**
- OLD: Write every line yourself
- NEW: Describe intent, review output, refine

**Key Principles:**

**1. Clear Intent Expression**
Bad: "Make a function"
Good: "Create a TypeScript function that takes an array of user objects and returns only users who were active in the last 7 days, sorted by last activity"

**2. Context is Everything**
- Provide file context
- Explain the system architecture
- Share relevant constraints
- Mention edge cases

**3. Iterative Refinement**
- Start broad, get specific
- "Now add error handling"
- "Make it handle null cases"
- "Optimize for performance"

**Tools of the Trade:**
| Tool | Best For |
|------|----------|
| Cursor | Full IDE experience |
| GitHub Copilot | Inline suggestions |
| Claude | Complex reasoning |
| ChatGPT | Quick solutions |
| Aider | Git-aware coding |

**Workflow:**
1. Describe the feature/problem
2. Review generated code
3. Ask for explanations
4. Request modifications
5. Test and refine

**Best Practices:**
- Always review AI code
- Understand before committing
- Keep context windows focused
- Use for boilerplate, customize for logic
- Learn from AI explanations

**Anti-patterns:**
- Blindly accepting code
- Ignoring security implications
- Not testing outputs
- Over-relying without understanding
