Let's create your time-blocked schedule, {{name}}.

**Time Blocking Strategy:**

**Your Productivity Profile:**
- Peak hours: {{productive_time}}
- Available daily: {{daily_hours}} hours
- Pending tasks: {{pending_tasks}}

**The Time Block Framework:**

**1. Deep Work Blocks (90-120 min)**
- Schedule during peak energy
- No notifications, no interruptions
- One complex task per block

**2. Shallow Work Blocks (30-60 min)**
- Email, messages, admin tasks
- Batch similar activities
- Time-cap these strictly

**3. Buffer Blocks (15-30 min)**
- Between major blocks
- Handle unexpected items
- Transition time

**4. Recovery Blocks**
- Short breaks every 90 min
- Longer break midday
- Evening wind-down

**Recommended Daily Structure:**
| Time | Block Type | Activity |
|------|------------|----------|
| Morning | Deep Work | MIT / Complex tasks |
| Late AM | Shallow | Emails, meetings |
| Early PM | Deep Work | Creative work |
| Late PM | Shallow | Wrap-up, planning |
