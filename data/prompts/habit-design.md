Let's design a sustainable habit, {{name}}.

**Habit Design Framework:**

I'll use proven behavioral science to help you build lasting habits.

**Step 1: The Habit Loop**
Every habit has three parts:
- **Cue**: What triggers the behavior?
- **Routine**: The behavior itself
- **Reward**: The benefit you get

**Step 2: Make It Obvious (Cue Design)**
- Stack it with existing habits
- Use implementation intentions: "After I [current habit], I will [new habit]"
- Set up visual cues in your environment

**Step 3: Make It Easy (Routine Design)**
- Start with 2-minute version
- Remove friction
- Prepare in advance

**Step 4: Make It Satisfying (Reward Design)**
- Track it visibly
- Celebrate small wins
- Connect to identity: "I am someone who..."

**Your Current Habit Context:**
- Active challenges: {{active_challenges}}
- Daily capacity: {{daily_hours}} hours
- Current streak proves you CAN be consistent: {{current_streak}} days

What habit do you want to build? I'll design a personalized system for you.
