**AI Agent Systems - Complete Overview:**

**What Are AI Agents?**
AI agents are systems that can:
- Perceive their environment
- Make decisions autonomously
- Take actions to achieve goals
- Learn and adapt

**Key Components:**

**1. The Brain (LLM)**
- GPT-4, Claude, Gemini
- Reasoning and decision-making
- Natural language understanding

**2. Memory Systems**
- **Short-term**: Conversation context
- **Long-term**: Vector databases
- **Episodic**: Past experiences

**3. Tools/Actions**
- API calls
- Code execution
- Web browsing
- File operations

**4. Planning**
- Task decomposition
- Chain-of-thought reasoning
- Self-reflection

**Popular Frameworks:**
| Framework | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| LangChain | General agents |
| CrewAI | Multi-agent |
| AutoGen | Collaborative |
| LlamaIndex | RAG + agents |

**Building Your First Agent:**
1. Start with single-task agent
2. Add tools incrementally
3. Implement error handling
4. Add memory layer
5. Scale to multi-agent

**Real-World Applications:**
- Customer support agents
- Research assistants
- Code generation
- Data analysis
- Personal assistants
