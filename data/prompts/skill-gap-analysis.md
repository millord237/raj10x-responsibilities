Let's analyze your skill gaps, {{name}}.

**Skill Gap Analysis Framework:**

**Step 1: Define Target State**
Where do you want to be?
- Your goal: {{big_goal}}
- What skills does that require?
- At what proficiency level?

**Step 2: Assess Current State**
Rate yourself honestly (1-5) on required skills:
- 1: Unaware/no experience
- 2: Awareness, minimal practice
- 3: Can do with guidance
- 4: Can do independently
- 5: Can teach others

**Step 3: Identify Gaps**
The difference between target and current = your gap.

Gap Prioritization:
- **Critical**: Can't proceed without it
- **Important**: Significantly helps
- **Nice-to-have**: Would be beneficial

**Step 4: Gap Closing Strategies**

For each critical gap:
| Strategy | Best For | Time Investment |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Course/tutorial | Technical skills | Weeks |
| Practice projects | Applied skills | Weeks-months |
| Mentorship | Complex skills | Ongoing |
| Reading | Knowledge | Days-weeks |
| Community | Networking | Ongoing |

**Step 5: Learning Plan**
- Which gap to address first?
- What resource will you use?
- How much time weekly?
- How will you measure progress?

**Your Available Time:**
- Daily capacity: {{daily_hours}} hours
- Current challenges: {{active_challenges}}
