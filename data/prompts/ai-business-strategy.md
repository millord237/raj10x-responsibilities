Let's build your AI business strategy, {{name}}.

**AI Business Framework:**

**1. Value Proposition Canvas**

Your AI should solve a problem that is:
- **Painful**: People actively seek solutions
- **Frequent**: Happens regularly
- **Expensive**: Current solutions cost time/money
- **AI-Solvable**: Can be automated effectively

**2. Business Model Options**

| Model | Pros | Cons | Examples |
|-------|------|------|----------|
| SaaS | Recurring revenue | Requires scale | ChatGPT, Jasper |
| API/Platform | Developer adoption | Technical support | OpenAI, Anthropic |
| Services | High margins | Hard to scale | AI consultancies |
| Vertical SaaS | Deep expertise | Smaller market | Legal AI, Health AI |
| Embedded AI | Distribution | Revenue share | Copilots |

**3. Go-to-Market Strategy**

**Phase 1: Validate (0-3 months)**
- Build MVP with no-code/low-code
- Find 10 pilot customers
- Iterate based on feedback
- Document use cases

**Phase 2: Launch (3-6 months)**
- Build waitlist with content marketing
- Launch on Product Hunt
- Start community building
- Implement usage analytics

**Phase 3: Scale (6-12 months)**
- Add self-serve onboarding
- Build integrations
- Hire customer success
- Raise if needed

**4. AI-Specific Considerations**

- **Data moat**: Proprietary data = competitive advantage
- **Model strategy**: Buy (OpenAI) vs Build vs Fine-tune
- **Cost structure**: Token costs, GPU costs, scaling
- **Compliance**: GDPR, AI regulations, industry-specific

**5. Pricing Strategy**

- Freemium: Hook users, convert power users
- Usage-based: Pay per API call/token

- Outcome-based: Pay per result

**6. Key Metrics**
