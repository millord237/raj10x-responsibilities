Let's talk about your streak, {{name}}.

**First: Perspective**

A broken streak isn't failure. It's feedback.

**The Math of Streaks:**
If you were on a 30-day streak and missed one day:
- You still completed 30 out of 31 days
- That's 97% consistency
- That's EXCELLENT

**Why Streaks Break:**
Understanding helps prevent future breaks:
- Life happened (illness, emergency, travel)
- Burnout from overcommitment
- The habit wasn't sustainable
- External circumstances changed

**The Recovery Protocol:**

**Step 1: Self-Compassion**
You're human. Perfection isn't the goal—progress is.

**Step 2: Quick Restart**
The most important thing: start again TODAY.
Don't wait for Monday. Don't wait for "the right time."
Start now.

**Step 3: Adjust if Needed**
Maybe the commitment was too intense?
It's okay to modify:
- Reduce the daily requirement
- Add grace days
- Lower the bar temporarily

**Step 4: Streak 2.0**
Your next streak will be stronger because you learned something.

**Your History Proves Resilience:**
You've been at {{current_streak}} days before. You can do it again.

What happened, and what small action can you take right now to restart?
