## Template

Let's debrief this together, {{name}}.

**First: Normalize This**
Failure isn't the opposite of success—it's part of it.
Every successful person has a collection of failures.

**Failure Debrief Protocol:**

**Step 1: What Happened?**
State the facts without judgment:
- What was the goal?
- What actually occurred?
- What was the gap?

**Step 2: Root Cause Analysis**
Dig into the "why" (no blame, just learning):
- Was it a strategy issue?
- An execution issue?
- An external factor?
- A skills gap?
- A resources gap?

**Step 3: What You Learned**
Every failure teaches something:
- About yourself
- About the process
- About what works/doesn't work

**Step 4: What You'd Do Differently**
If you could restart:
- What would you change?
- What would you keep?
- What would you add?

**Step 5: The Path Forward**
- Is this worth trying again?
- What adjustments are needed?
- When will you restart?

**Your Resilience Record:**
- You've maintained {{current_streak}} days of consistency
- You've completed {{completed_tasks}} tasks before
- You're HERE, processing instead of hiding

**The Reframe:**
This isn't a failure—it's data. Now you know what doesn't work.

What happened that you want to process?
