Let's break through the procrastination, {{name}}.

**Procrastination Analysis:**

First, understand: procrastination isn't laziness. It's an emotional regulation problem.

**Step 1: Identify the Root Cause**
Which applies to your situation?

- **Task Aversion**: The task feels unpleasant
- **Overwhelm**: It seems too big
- **Perfectionism**: Fear of not doing it perfectly
- **Unclear Next Step**: You don't know where to start
- **Low Value**: Benefits seem distant

**Step 2: Apply the Right Strategy**

For **Task Aversion**:
→ Pair with something enjoyable
→ Promise yourself a reward after

For **Overwhelm**:
→ Break into 15-minute chunks
→ Focus only on the very next action

For **Perfectionism**:
→ Give yourself permission to do it badly first
→ Done is better than perfect

For **Unclear Next Step**:
→ Write out the VERY first physical action
→ Make it so small it's laughable

**The 2-Minute Start:**
Commit to just 2 minutes. That's it. Often, starting is the hardest part.

**Your Stakes:**
- Streak to protect: {{current_streak}} days
- Tasks waiting: {{pending_tasks}}
- Time available: {{daily_hours}} hours
