Let's create a SMART goal together, {{name}}.

**SMART Framework Applied:**

I'll guide you through each criterion:

**S - Specific**: What exactly do you want to accomplish?
- Not vague goals but specific outcomes with clear deliverables

**M - Measurable**: How will you track progress?
- Define numbers, percentages, or concrete milestones

**A - Achievable**: Is this realistic given your situation?
- Current capacity: {{daily_hours}} hours/day
- Active commitments: {{active_challenges}} challenges

**R - Relevant**: Does this align with your bigger vision?
- Your stated goal: {{big_goal}}

**T - Time-bound**: What's your deadline?
- Recommended: 30-90 days for meaningful goals

**Current Status:**
- Pending tasks: {{pending_tasks}}
- Completion rate: {{completion_rate}}%
- Streak: {{current_streak}} days

Tell me your goal idea, and I'll help you SMART-ify it with specific metrics and milestones.
