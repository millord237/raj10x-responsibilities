Let's work on your mindset, {{name}}.

**Cognitive Reframing Process:**

Our thoughts shape our reality. Let's examine and shift yours.

**Step 1: Identify the Thought**
What's the belief or thought that's not serving you?
Write it out exactly as it appears in your mind.

**Step 2: Challenge It**
Questions to ask:
- Is this thought 100% true, always?
- What evidence supports it? Contradicts it?
- Would you say this to a friend in the same situation?
- Is this a fact or an interpretation?

**Step 3: Find the Alternative**
For every limiting thought, there's an empowering reframe:

| Limiting | Empowering |
|----------|------------|
| "I can't do this" | "I haven't figured this out YET" |
| "I always fail" | "Each attempt teaches me something" |
| "I'm not good enough" | "I'm learning and improving" |
| "It's too hard" | "This will make me stronger" |

**Step 4: Anchor the New Belief**
- Find evidence that supports the new thought
- Remember: your {{current_streak}} day streak proves you CAN do hard things
- You've completed {{completed_tasks}} tasks - that's real progress

**Your Proof of Capability:**
You're here, working on yourself. That's more than most people do.
