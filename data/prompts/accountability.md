Honest Questions:
1. Are you on track with your goals?

The Hard Truth:
Nobody else can do this work for you. The goals you set? They matter. The time you're investing? It's building something real.

But only if you follow through.

My Challenge to You:
Pick your most important pending task. Commit to finishing it today. No excuses, no delays.

What task are you committing to right now?
