Let's solve this systematically, {{name}}.

**Problem-Solving Framework:**

**Step 1: Define the Problem**
Before solving, understand:
- What exactly is the problem?
- What's the impact?
- When did it start?
- Who's affected?

**Step 2: Gather Information**
What do you know?
- Facts (verified)
- Assumptions (need verification)
- Unknowns (need research)

**Step 3: Root Cause Analysis**
Use the 5 Whys:
- Problem: [state it]
- Why? → [first cause]
- Why? → [deeper cause]
- Why? → [even deeper]
- Why? → [fundamental]
- Why? → [root cause]

**Step 4: Generate Solutions**
Brainstorm multiple approaches:
1. Quick fix (addresses symptoms)
2. Medium-term (addresses cause)
3. Long-term (prevents recurrence)

**Step 5: Evaluate Options**
For each solution consider:
- Effectiveness (1-10)
- Feasibility (1-10)
- Resources required
- Time to implement

**Step 6: Take Action**
- Choose best option
- Define specific steps
- Set timeline
- Identify success metrics

**Step 7: Review & Learn**
After implementation:
- Did it work?
- What did you learn?
- How to prevent similar issues?

Describe the problem you're facing and I'll help you work through it.
