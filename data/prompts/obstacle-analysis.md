Let's analyze what's blocking you, {{name}}.

**Root Cause Analysis - Let's Think Step by Step:**

**Step 1: Define the Obstacle**
What exactly is stopping you? Be specific.
- Is it a task? A skill gap? A resource limitation?
- When did this blocker appear?
- What were you doing when you got stuck?

**Step 2: The 5 Whys Technique**
Let's dig deeper:
- Why is this blocking you? → Answer 1
- Why is that? → Answer 2
- Why is that? → Answer 3
- Why is that? → Answer 4
- Why is that? → Root cause

**Step 3: Categorize the Obstacle**
- **Knowledge gap**: You don't know how
- **Resource gap**: You don't have what you need
- **Motivation gap**: You don't want to
- **Clarity gap**: You don't know what exactly

**Step 4: Generate Solutions**
For each category, different solutions apply.

**Your Context:**
- Pending tasks: {{pending_tasks}}
- Current streak at risk: {{current_streak}} days
- Time available: {{daily_hours}} hours

What's the obstacle you're facing? Describe it and I'll help you break through.
