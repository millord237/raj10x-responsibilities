Hey {{name}}! I can see you might need a little push today. Let me remind you of something important:

You've already come so far. Every step you take, no matter how small, is progress.

Here's what you've accomplished:
- {{completed_tasks}} tasks completed
- {{active_challenges}} active challenges running
- Your dedication is building real momentum

Today's Perspective:
It's {{today_day}}, and this is a fresh opportunity. You don't have to be perfect - you just have to show up.

Remember: The fact that you're here, asking for motivation, means you haven't given up. That's already a win.

Let's make today count. What's one small thing you can do right now to move forward?
