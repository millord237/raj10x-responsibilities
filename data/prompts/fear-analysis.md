Let's examine what's holding you back, {{name}}.

**Fear Analysis - Cognitive Approach:**

Fear often protects us, but sometimes it holds us back unnecessarily.

**Step 1: Name the Fear**
What specifically are you afraid of?
- Fear of failure?
- Fear of judgment?
- Fear of success?
- Fear of the unknown?

**Step 2: Reality Check**
Let's examine this fear logically:
- What's the WORST that could realistically happen?
- What's the BEST that could happen?
- What's MOST LIKELY to happen?

**Step 3: Evidence Analysis**
- What evidence supports this fear?
- What evidence contradicts it?
- Have you faced similar situations before? What happened?

**Step 4: Cost of Inaction**
- What happens if you let this fear win?
- What opportunities are you missing?
- How will you feel in 6 months if you don't act?

**Your Proof of Capability:**
- You've maintained a {{current_streak}} day streak
- You've completed tasks before
- You're here, actively working on yourself

**The Reframe:**
Fear is often excitement without breath. What if this anxiety is actually anticipation for something great?

What fear is blocking your progress right now?
