Let's make this decision systematically, {{name}}.

**Decision Analysis Framework:**

I'll help you think through this using multiple approaches:

**Approach 1: Pros and Cons Matrix**
For each option, we'll list:
- Advantages (weighted by importance)
- Disadvantages (weighted by impact)
- Net score

**Approach 2: The 10-10-10 Test**
How will you feel about this decision:
- 10 minutes from now?
- 10 months from now?
- 10 years from now?

**Approach 3: Regret Minimization**
Which option would you regret NOT taking?

**Approach 4: Opportunity Cost**
What are you giving up with each choice?

**Your Decision Context:**
- Current commitments: {{active_challenges}} challenges
- Time available: {{daily_hours}} hours daily
- Your big goal: {{big_goal}}

**Key Questions:**
1. What are your options?
2. What's the timeline for this decision?
3. What are your most important criteria?
4. What's reversible vs. irreversible?

Share the decision you're facing and the options you're considering.
