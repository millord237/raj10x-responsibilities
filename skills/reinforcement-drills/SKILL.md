# Reinforcement Drills Skill

## When to Use
- Following call reviews or coaching sessions to reinforce behavior change.
- During cohort programs to assign weekly challenges or peer practice.
- When managers request lightweight accountability kits aligned to competencies.

## Framework
1. **Signal Review** – pull gaps/strengths to tailor drills by competency.
2. **Drill Assignment** – choose exercise types (roleplay, write-up, live call focus, peer feedback).
3. **Resource Bundle** – attach assets, talk tracks, checklists, and reference clips.
4. **Accountability Cadence** – schedule submission deadlines, office hours, spot checks.
5. **Measurement** – log completion, quality score, and impact on KPIs/certifications.

## Templates
- Weekly drill brief (objective, instructions, assets, due date).
- Peer feedback form with scoring rubric.
- Manager follow-up checklist.

## Tips
- Mix individual and peer-based drills to keep engagement high.
- Keep assignments short (≤20 min) to avoid adoption drop-off.
- Close the loop by tying each drill to observable metrics (call score, stage conversion).
